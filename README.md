## Motivation
   I am a huge fan of the Eurovision Song Contest and I created my first directed graph in Python using Eurovision 2016 results!

In my network analysis, I compared the results to identify trends and connections. The nodes represent countries and the edges represent the voting patterns between them. I located the countries in geographical positions and the flag sizes represent their total points.

The reason I chose 2016 is that there were huge differences between jury votes and televoting during that year. Eurovision is known for neighbors voting for each other. To alleviate that, European Broadcasting Union brought the professional jury votes into the mix. That year, Australia received the highest points from the Jury, meanwhile Russia won the televote. Surprisingly, neither one of them won. The winner was Ukraine. The biggest contrast between these two votes was for Poland. Poland got only 7 points from the Jury and 222 points from the public.

It was so much fun working on this project. Network analysis is different from other visualization tools and can be useful in many situations.
Happy Eurovision Season! :)
