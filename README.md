# Eurovision Network Analysis

## Motivation
   I am a huge fan of the Eurovision Song Contest. I wanted to create a directed graph with Eurovision Song Contest 2016 results. I wanted to compare the results and see the connections. In the project, the nodes represent countries and the edges represent the voting connections between the countries.  I located the countries in geological positions and the flag sizes represent their total points. 

The reason I chose 2016 is there were huge differences between jury votes and televoting. In Eurovision, there is a controversy for a long time that countries vote for the neighbors. The EBU brought the professional jury votes against this. Especially in 2016, Australia from the jury and Russia from the televoting got the highest points. Surprisingly either one of them did not win. The winner was Ukraine. The most shocking result for sure was Poland. Poland got only 7 points from the jury and 222 points from the public.
